## Other info

This version addresses some CRAN check NOTES that have appeared due to empty
sections in `.Rd` files, and some un-escaped braces. The empty sections were due
to documentation generated by `roxygen2` and have been addressed by using a
patched version of `roxygen2` with transitive documentation inheritance.
Regenerating Rd files with vanilla `roxygen2` will cause reversion of the error.
The patch has been submitted as a PR to `roxygen2`.

There is no new functionality.
