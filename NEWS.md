# dtrackr 0.2.5

* updates following JOSS review: changes in documentation have resulted in
additional `Suggests` dependencies on CRAN packages.
* bug fix for group_by not checking pause status before warning that pause required.
* documentation improvements - full review of all documentation. Additional
context to function reference to draw attention to supported dplyr operations 
* added `nest_join.tracked_df` S3 method, added `slice*.tracked_df` functions, and 
missing set operations functions. 
* re-factored mutate style operations, regression tested
* automated testing for new methods, and full testing for slice, set ops, and mutate style
functions with new example code.
* expanded test coverage ( `covr::package_coverage(type="all"` ):
`dtrackr` Coverage: 83.60%,
`R/dot.R`: 78.12%,
`R/dtrackr.R`: 84.08%) mostly through examples
* improved error handling and reporting in mutate functions.
* bug #25 & #26 fixes (see github) 
* Logo and documentation fixes and improvements.
* outstanding issues: 
* re-use of documentation results in examples tests running multiple times.

# dtrackr 0.2.0

* track excluded items with debugging info
* allow across syntax in most situations (except group_by)
* support pausing and un-pausing of the dataframe tracking
* preventing massive group_by groups if large numbers of very small groups are selected (e.g. part of a group_by() %>% mutate())
* switch warnings to rlang::warn etc.
